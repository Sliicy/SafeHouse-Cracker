# SafeHouse-Cracker
Recovers a forgotten SafeHouse password.

Based on the fantastic SafeHouse Explorer (http://www.safehousesoftware.com/SafeHouseExplorer.aspx), this program attempts to recover a forgotten password by trying every specified possible character. It sends the passwords as keypresses to the Safe House window, and will pause if the window loses focus.
